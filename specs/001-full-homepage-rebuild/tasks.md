# Tasks: Full Homepage Rebuild

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-full-homepage-rebuild/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, contracts/contact-api.yaml, research.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js App Router**: `app/`, `components/`, `types/`, `data/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`
- All component files follow pattern: `ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx` + `ComponentName.module.css` + `index.ts`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if desired (with separate developers)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US3 (P3)**: Builds on US1 (navigation) and US2 (contact form) but can be done independently
- **US4 (P4)**: Optimizes US1 components but can be done independently
- **US5 (P5)**: Independent, only modifies layout.tsx and adds public files
- **US6 (P6)**: Wraps US1 and US2 in error boundaries, should come after those are stable

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Sequential tasks must complete in order (same file or dependencies)

- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story works in isolation
- TypeScript must compile with zero errors before completing any user story
- All visual neumorphic components must remain pixel-perfect identical to current design
- All content must be preserved character-for-character from current site
- Lighthouse gates: Accessibility ‚â•95, Performance ‚â•90 mobile/‚â•95 desktop, SEO ‚â•95
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks

## Post-Implementation Refinements

### Mobile Menu Alignment Fixes (2025-10-10)

**Issue**: Mobile hamburger menu buttons were left-aligned with whitespace on right side

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- NeumorphicCard's `.cardInner` used `align-items: flex-start` (prevented children from stretching)
- NeumorphicButton lacked explicit flexbox centering in `.buttonInner`
- No full-width button variant available in component API
- Text element used `display: block` without explicit centering

**Fixes Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Changed NeumorphicCard `.cardInner` to `align-items: stretch`
- ‚úÖ Added flexbox centering to NeumorphicButton `.buttonInner` (`display: flex`, `align-items: center`, `justify-content: center`)
- ‚úÖ Updated button text to `display: inline-block` with `text-align: center` and `white-space: nowrap`
- ‚úÖ Added `fullWidth?: boolean` prop to NeumorphicButton component
- ‚úÖ Created `.fullWidth` CSS variant that sets `width: 100%` on all button layers
- ‚úÖ Applied `fullWidth={true}` to all mobile menu buttons in Navigation.tsx
- ‚úÖ Added explicit `width: 100%` to `.mobileMenuItems` container

**Files Modified**:
- `components/NeumorphicCard/NeumorphicCard.module.css` (line 35)
- `components/NeumorphicButton/NeumorphicButton.tsx` (added fullWidth prop)
- `components/NeumorphicButton/NeumorphicButton.module.css` (lines 59-62, 125-127, 145-152)
- `components/Navigation/Navigation.tsx` (lines 113, 123)
- `components/Navigation/Navigation.module.css` (line 74)

**Documentation**: See `MOBILE_MENU_ALIGNMENT_FIXES.md` for comprehensive technical analysis

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome Mobile
- ‚úÖ Tested at viewports: 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px+, 1024px+
- ‚úÖ All neumorphic design effects preserved
- ‚úÖ Focus trap and accessibility features intact
- ‚úÖ Hot reload successful (5 recompilations)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation with zero errors

**Result**: Mobile menu buttons now stretch edge-to-edge with perfectly centered text, professional appearance maintained across all mobile devices.
