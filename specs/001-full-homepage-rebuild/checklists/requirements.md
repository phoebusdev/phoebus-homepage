# Specification Quality Checklist: Full Homepage Rebuild

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ All Pass
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- No mention of specific frameworks (Next.js, React, TypeScript) in requirements - these are implied by existing codebase
- All user stories written from visitor/client perspective
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ All Pass
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements have informed defaults documented in Assumptions
- All 71 functional requirements are testable with specific criteria
- All 37 success criteria have measurable metrics (scores, percentages, time limits)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Contact form succeeds in under 2 seconds") not implementation (e.g., "API returns 200")
- 6 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- Edge cases section covers JavaScript disabled, extreme viewports, service failures, etc.
- Scope clearly bounded to homepage rebuild, not full site
- 14 assumptions documented covering email service, analytics, browser support, etc.

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ All Pass
- Each functional requirement maps to success criteria (e.g., FR-011 focus indicators → SC-004 visible focus)
- User scenarios cover: browsing (P1), contact form (P2), accessibility (P3), performance (P4), SEO (P5), errors (P6)
- All success criteria measurable without knowing implementation details
- No leaked implementation details in specification

## Status

**Checklist Status**: ✅ ALL ITEMS PASSING

**Ready for Next Phase**: YES

**Recommended Next Step**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section. Ready to proceed directly to planning phase.
